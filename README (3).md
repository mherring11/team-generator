# Team Profile generator

My project is a README generator. The project will help a user generate a README without having to worry about applying proper mark down syntax.

This README generator will allow the user to answer a series of specific questions and create a professional complete README based on their responses. It will take a couple minutes and provide the developer with the ability to make their project complete and more professional, increasing the likely hood that someone will want to use their app over similar apps without a README.


## Installation

Click the repository link below.  Clone to a directory of your choice using your terminal. Open the file in VS Code or whatever editor you work with. Open the terminal in VS Code and make sure you’re in the Develop folder. You're now ready to use the README generator.
